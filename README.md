# House-Price-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

A machine learning project focused on predicting house prices using structured data. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and model training using regression techniques. Visualizations and performance evaluations are included to ensure accuracy.

# House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. It covers the full pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Project Structure

- train.csv - Training dataset
- test.csv - Testing dataset
- sample_submission.csv - Format for submission
- House prediction1.ipynb - Main notebook with code and analysis

## Workflow

1. Data Loading  
   Load datasets using pandas.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
   Analyze data distributions, missing values, and feature relationships using visualizations and statistics.

3. Data Preprocessing  
   Clean and transform the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

4. Model Building  
   Train regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or ensemble methods like Random Forest and XGBoost.

5. Evaluation and Prediction  
   Evaluate models using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE) and generate predictions for the test data.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Future Improvements

- Add hyperparameter tuning
